# NDT Job Order – Frappe Automation Suite

## Overview
This repository contains the **Job Order design** for managing NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) jobs in Frappe. The Job Order includes all essential sections required for execution, tracking, and reporting while minimizing manual work.

The key focus areas are:  
- Selecting multiple test methods per job.  
- Managing assets and consumables.  
- Assigning manpower/resources.  
- Generating tasks automatically per test method.  
- Logging timesheets for tracking execution.  
- Generating test reports automatically.

## Features

### 1. Test Methods
- Multi-select: UT, PT, PAUT, RT, MT, VT, etc.  
- Multiple tests can be chosen for a single Job Order.  

### 2. Assets
- Machines and tools required per test (e.g., UT machine, PAUT system, MPI yoke).  
- Calibration status auto-checked.  

### 3. Consumables
- Materials like dye penetrant, film, couplant, wipes, etc.  
- Stock automatically reserved from inventory.  

### 4. Resources / Manpower
- Assign NDT Level II, III, Helpers, Welders.  
- Auto-check certifications and availability.  

### 5. Tasks
- Auto-generate steps per selected test method.  
- Example: PT → Surface prep → Apply penetrant → Dwell → Remove → Developer → Interpretation.  
- Link tasks with manpower and estimated time.  

### 6. Timesheets
- Employees log time per task (mobile or desktop).  
- Track planned vs actual time.  
- Auto-calculate overtime.  

### 7. Reports
- Each test method generates its own report (PT, PAUT, UT, etc.).  
- Auto-fill customer, asset, operator, procedure, and acceptance criteria.  
- Technicians only fill measurement/defect details.  
- Auto-sign workflow: Technician → Level II → Level III → Customer.
